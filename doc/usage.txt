FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:

 To start the client with all functionality, in three separate command windows
 (or on three separate machines) run the following commands:
	java RunClient
	java RunGroupServer 8080
	java RunFileServer 8081
 
 To start ClientApp: java RunClient
 This GUI is designed to fulfill functionality. The Home tab handles
 logins and creating/deleting users, Group Servers tab handles all 
 GroupServer functionality, and File Servers tab handles all FileServer
 functionality. 

 The Home tab also handled login and authentication. This includes updating 
 login credentials. The button ''Update RSA'' updates the public RSA key that
 is set for this user specified by the key in the file path that is entered. 
 The button ''Setup Two Factor'' will generate a key that is a secret between
 the user and the groupserver. This key is to be entered into the google 
 authenticator app to generate codes that are used for two factor authentication.

 To start Group Server: java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username The user will also be prompted to enter the path to the file
 where their public key is stored. This name becomes the first user and is a 
 member of the ADMIN group.  Also, no other groups exist.  A custom port can be 
 passed as the first command line argument.

 The GUI Client defaults to connect to port 8080 of the localhost. Please run 
 RunGroupServer as:
	java RunGroupServer 8080
 or else enter the port number that you specified when running the Group Server
 in the group port field. If the group server is being run on a different 
 machine please enter the machine's name in the Group address field. Click login 
 to connect to the group server and gain access to various group operations.

 To start the File Server: java RunFileServer [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online. A custom port can be passed as 
 the first command line argument.
 
 The GUI Client defaults to connect to port 8081 of the localhost. Please run 
 RunFileServer as:
	java RunFileServer 8081
 or else enter the port number that you specified when running the File Server 
 in the file port field. If the file server is being run on a different machine 
 please enter the machine's name in the File address field and press connect. 
 Press `connect to FS` to connect to the file server. If you want to connect to 
 another file server enter the machine name and port number and click `connect 
 to FS`. This will disconnect from the original file server and connect to the 
 new one.

 To switch users on the system click `Logout`. Enter a new username and click 
 `Login`.

 Group and File operations are preformed with buttons and text fields in the GUI. 
 When selecting a group or file click on the group or file name in the list fields.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin and GroupList.bin.
 
 Note that this implementation supports server side directories.
