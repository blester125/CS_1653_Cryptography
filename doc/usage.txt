FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:

 To start the client with all functionality, in three separate command windows
 run the following commands:
	java RunClient
	java RunGroupServer 8080
	java RunFileServer 8081
 
 To start ClientApp: java RunClient
 This GUI is designed to fulfill future functionality that is not yet
 implemented for this phase (such as passwords, etc...). The Home tab handles
 logins and creating/deleting users, Group Servers tab handles all 
 GroupServer functionality, and File Servers tab handles all FileServer
 functionality. 

 To start Group Server: java RunGroupServer [(optional) port number]
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the
 ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  A custom port can be passed as the first 
 command line argument.

 The GUI Client defaults to connect to port 8080 for this phase. Please run 
 RunGroupServer as:
	java RunGroupServer 8080

 To start the File Server: java RunFileServer [(optional) port number]
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online. A custom port can be passed as 
 the first command line argument.
 
 The GUI Client expects the FileServer to be a port number 1 greater than the
 GroupServer FOR THIS PHASE ONLY. Please run RunFileServer as:
	java RunFileServer 8081

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin and GroupList.bin.
 
 Note that this implementation supports server side directories.
