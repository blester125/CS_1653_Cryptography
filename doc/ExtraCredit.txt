Phase 2: For extra credit we created a GUI for the client application

In accordance with the rule of least privilege we added the ability 
for users list files only within a certain group in addition to all 
of their files. In a similar vein when deleteing or downloading a 
file a group must be choosen. 

Phase 3: For extra credit we implemented a log in option that uses
RSA public key cryptography and signed diffie hellman to supplement
the noraml password login procedure.

Phase 4: For extra credit we implemented the option to enable two 
factor authentication on accounts. This is done using TOTP and the 
google authenticator app.
