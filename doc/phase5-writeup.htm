      <h2>Overview</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Most of the threats outlined in this section revolve around the untrustworthiness of the machines that the group/file server run on. The trust models for the individual parts break down like this: <br><b>Group Server:</b> The group server is still entirely trustworthy.<br><b>File Server:</b> The file server is trust for the same things that it is trusted in part 4 of the project. The difference is that it is no longer trusted to not modify the files on disk.<br><b>Clients:</b> Clients are still entirely untrusted.<br><b>Machines that the programs are run on:</b> These are entirely untrusted.</p>

    <section id="threatmodel">
      <h2>Threat Model</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Define a threat model within which your implementation is subject to attack.
You may re-use a threat model from another phase of the project, or you may
define a new threat model (e.g., What if we were worried about more than just
the file leakage from a file server? What if the group server was mostly
trusted, but the password file or other state was somehow leaked? What about the
possibility of DoS or DDoS attacks?). This threat model should be written up in
the same format as the threat models that you were given for Phases P3 and P4 of
the project.</p>


    <section id="threat8">
      <h2>Threat T8: Snooping System Admin</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat model is that a System Admin (or anyone that is using the machine that the group model is running on) could read or modify the GroupList and the UserList that the group server uses to save state.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat9">
      <h2>Threat T9: Theft of the Groupserver private key</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat model is that a user on the machine that the group server is running on could steal the group servers private key from the "groupserverprivate.key" file</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat10">
      <h2>Threat T10: File Modification</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat is that the file server (or a user on the machine that the file server runs on) may modify the files that are saved on disk.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat11">
      <h2>Threat T11: Unprotected File Server Key</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat is that a user on the file server machine could steal the file servers private key from the "fileserverprivate.key" file.

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat12">
      <h2>Threat T12: Lack of Plausible Deniability</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat is if an adversary (or a malicious server) records client server interactions then they can prove that the user took part in this conversation. 

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>    


<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="attack">
      <h2>Attacks</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Write a clear and concise description of the attacks against your
implementation. Describe each step of the attack, and include protocol diagrams
to clarify your discussion as needed. Provide evidence for why these attacks are
possible, and why they represent a threat against your system.</p>

<p>If your group implemented programs to demonstrate your attacks, discuss these
programs here.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="countermeasure">
      <h2>Countermeasures</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Write a clear and concise description of the mechanism that your group
proposes to address each attack from the previous section. Follow the format
described in Phases P3 and P4 of the project: describe the mechanism in detail
(including protocol diagrams as needed) and provide justification for why your
proposed mechanism is sufficient for addressing the threat that you have
discovered.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>
    <section id="discussion">
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Conclude with a paragraph or two discussing your threat model and
countermeasure mechanisms. How realistic is your threat model for a real-life
file sharing system? Comment on the design process that your group followed. Did
you discuss other ideas that didn’t pan out before settling on the
above-documented approach? Did you design attacks that you were unable to
mitigate, or that you think are impossible to mitigate? Use this space to show
off your hard work!</p>

<p>Finally, spend a paragraph discussing the interplay between the
countermeasures for your proposed attacks and your techniques for mitigating
threats T1–T7 from Phases P3 and P4 of the project. Did you have to design your
countermeasures in a particular way so as not to re-introduce these older
threats?</p>

<p>If your group implemented the countermeasures or did any extra credit, please
discuss these additional contributions in this section, as well.</p>
