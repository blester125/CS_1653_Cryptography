      <h2>Overview</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
      <p>
      Our general threat model relies on weakened assumptions primarily dealing with the 
      untrusted nature of the local machines and what is stored on disk on the servers.
      The threat model encompasses having files that are saved long term on the server be vulnerable,
      and so confidentiallity and integrity measures are in place. There are also threats
      against DoS attacks and a vulnerability that partially remained from the previous phases
      concerning information leakage via group naming. The former is taken care of via
      a simple computational puzzle and the latter via a fix that assigns unique identifiers to group names.
      <p/>
<!-- <p>Most of the threats outlined in this section revolve around the untrustworthiness of the machines that the group/file server run on. The trust models for the individual parts break down like this: 

<br><b>Group Server:</b> The group server is still entirely trustworthy.<br><b>File Server:</b> The file server is trust for the same things that it is trusted in part 4 of the project. The difference is that it is no longer trusted to not modify the files on disk.<br><b>Clients:</b> Clients are still entirely untrusted.<br><b>Machines that the programs are run on:</b> These are entirely untrusted.</p> -->

      <h2>Threat Model</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<!-- <p>Define a threat model within which your implementation is subject to attack.
You may re-use a threat model from another phase of the project, or you may
define a new threat model (e.g., What if we were worried about more than just
the file leakage from a file server? What if the group server was mostly
trusted, but the password file or other state was somehow leaked? What about the
possibility of DoS or DDoS attacks?). This threat model should be written up in
the same format as the threat models that you were given for Phases P3 and P4 of
the project.</p>
 -->
<p>
Here we characterize the behavior of the principles that may be present in our 
system.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Group Server</b>: The group server is entirely trusted. In this phase 
    of the project, this means the group server will only issue tokens to 
    properly authenticated clients and will properly enforce the constraints on 
    group creation, deletion, and management specified in previous phases of the 
    project. The group server is not assumed to share secrets with the file 
    servers in the system. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>File Server</b>: In this phase of the project, file servers will be 
    assumed to be largely untrusted. In particular, file servers might leak 
    files, attempt to steal user tokens, or modify files on disk. Note that this 
    does not include file deletion, as such a guard would provide little benefit 
    to the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Clients</b>: We will assume the clients are completely untrustworthy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Attackers</b>: All communication within the system might be intercepted 
    by an active that can insert, reorder, replay, or modify messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Server Environment</b>: Assume that the machines that the servers run on 
    are largely untrusted. This means that the sensitive files which should 
    remain known only to the server could be viewed by an unauthorized user
    by an oversight from the untrusted server admin.

  </li>
</ul>


    <section id="threat8">
      <h2>Threat T8: Theft of Server State</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat model is that a System Admin (or anyone that is using the machine 
that the servers are running on) could read or modify the GroupList, UserList,
and/or the FileList that the various servers use to save state. This could be
due to multiple reasons such as improperly configured servers saving their
files in shared system directories or accounts being left logged-in and unlocked
on unshared machines.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat9">
      <h2>Threat T9: Theft of the server's private key</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>This threat is that since keys are currently trusted to be stored as plaintext
files on the machine, that they may be stolen by another user or a system admin,
as outlined in T8 where the server admin cannot be trusted to manage the secrecy
of their local account, and by extension a server's private key. If this private
key is stolen, an attacker could then impersonate a server.</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat10">
      <h2>Threat T10: File Modification</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>Due to the untrusted nature of the file server and the untrusted machine it 
is running on, a file that is saved to disk could be modified.
</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat11">
      <h2>Threat T11: Information Leakage via Group Naming</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>
This threat can be distinctly divided into two subthreats. The first being 
the threat of allowing for reuse of a group name, whereby a user could incidentally
or purposefully gain access to an old deleted group by using the same name. 
</p>
<p>
This initial threat was partially addressed in a prior phase of the project with 
the disallowance of repeated group names, but this also is a source of 
information leakage. By providing information about group names that are in use, 
it compromises the assumed privacy of the system, where all group information 
should only be known to members of said group.
</p>

<!-- END CHANGES HERE -->
    </section>

    <section id="threat11">
      <h2>Threat T12: Denial of Service</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->
<p>
Many users connecting to the server will create a flood of requests that utilize 
server state, leaving the server borderline unusable by legitimate users. This 
may also bring the server completely down or severely cripple it.
</p>

<!-- <p>
Our current implementation of file servers provide no protection against the 
theft of a file server's private RSA key (in the case of the machine being 
compromised). Despite file servers being largely untrusted, it is still an 
issue to provide absolutely no protection against the physical compromise of a 
file server. In the event of a file server machine being compromised in our 
current implementation, an attacker could host a fake file server that would 
act as an already-authenticated file server. This server could then proceed to 
host malicious versions of user files or simply leak the files to other users or 
onto the internet (although we have already protected against this in T6 of 
Phase 4 via the Leslie-Lamport one-time password scheme).

      <h2>Attacks</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<h3>Attack leveraged via Threat 8</h3>
An attacker could load up the GroupList, FileList and/or the UserList into their own
server implementation (this is possible because the GroupList, FileList, and UserList are unencrypted and the implementation of the objects that underlying these lists is known due to transparency of mechanism) and start maliciously modify these files. The attacker could add a new account and then add that new user to each group. This is dangerous because they could access any sensitive files in the groups they add themselves too. They could even add themselves to the admin group. Modifying the FileList also allows them
to grant themselves access to a group's files. While the files are all encrypted,
the file names are still leaked. With access to these file lists and by impersonating
a server, an attacker effectively gains free reign over the entire system. 
<h3>Attack leveraged via Threat 9</h3>
"groupserverprivate.key" is unencrypted on the disk so if a user on that machine were to steal that file they would have the group servers private key. This could be used to create fake tokens. These fake tokens could then be signed with this key which would cause them to be accepted. "fileserverprivate.key" is unencrypted on the disk so if a user steals the private key for the file server they can impersonate the file server. This can lead to the clients uploading a sensitive file to the fake server.
<h3>Attack leveraged via Threat 10</h3> 
Files on the disk for the file server could be modified. This modification would not be detected so any changes could junk the file or worse they could be changed and the changes would not be noticed which could lead to incorrect information. An attack via modification is more important to 
protect against than deletion because deletion will be known as soon as a file is 
requested, with nothing being returned. Deletion also serves no purpose as an 
attack other than messing with the users, which could also be done by just 
cutting the cord. Modification, on the other hand, could be used as an actual 
attack. Modification could also be carried out by swapping blocks of the real 
file with blocks from an older version of the file where the key has yet to be 
evolved. This can cause legible changes outside of small errors at block 
boundaries.
<h3>Attack leveraged via Threat 11</h3>
There are two manifestations of this attack: the first being a user choosing a 
group name that is already in use on the system. This causes an error to be 
returned and the group is not created. This leaks information in that the user 
trying to create a group knows the name of another group known on the system, 
which goes against the privacy of the system.
<br><br>
The second attack is the user choosing the name of a group that had previously 
been deleted. When logging in to a file server that this group used, this new 
group could access files that belonged to the old group. This threat is slightly 
mitigated due to the backwards secrecy provided by group keys, however 
information is still leaked in file names and file sizes.
<h3>Attack leveraged via Threat 12</h3>
A DoS attack on the system causes a build-up of state and excessive resource 
consumption on the server. This slows down the speed of real requests to the 
server. Using our own DoS and benchmarking programs (Dos.java and BenchMark.java 
respectively), we have shown that our server processed 1/40th of the speed 
during a simple DoS attack (27,000ms vs. 700ms). This increased slowdown is an 
attack on availability, which is an attack on a part of the  CIA triad that we 
have not yet considered.

<!-- <p>Write a clear and concise description of the attacks against your
implementation. Describe each step of the attack, and include protocol diagrams
to clarify your discussion as needed. Provide evidence for why these attacks are
possible, and why they represent a threat against your system.</p>

<h3>Mechanism to Defend Against Threat 8</h3>
<p>
In order to defend against this threat, a mechanism must be developed to protect 
the existence of the server's state files (GroupList.bin, UserList.bin, 
FileList.bin) on disk, so that even if the 
state files are physically stolen, they cannot be used or modified by an attacker 
to gain information. This can be achieved through the use of the "starter's" (server 
administrator's) private key. On the execution of the server, the starter's 
private RSA key (which the starter will type in manually) is used to generate a 
confidentiality and integrity key that will be used to encrypt and verify the 
server's state files when it is loaded from disk. 
The two keys are <b>k<sub>c</sub></b>, used for encryption, 
and <b>k<sub>i</sub></b> which is used for integrity checks. The keys are 
generated by hashing, using SHA-256, the starter's private RSA key concatenated 
with "confidentiality" and "integrity" respectively. After the server 
private key is successfully loaded and verified, it is used as normal throughout 
the system as outlined in our previous phases.
</p>
<p>
This mechanism is sufficient for defending against this threat. 
The server administrator (starter) is tasked with the responsibility 
of keeping his/her private RSA key (used to create <b>k<sub>c</sub></b> and 
<b>k<sub>i</sub></b> to protect the server private RSA key) safe from 
compromise. It is safe to create these keys from the private key due to 
our cryptographically secure hash functions which has preimage resistance.
The compromise of one key will reveal nothing about another key. This means that the key used to protect the server state files 
is not present on the system, and the state files will not be stolen in the result of a machine 
compromise of any verified server or modified due to the HMAC. It is acceptable to require the starter of a 
server to type in a full RSA key as both servers are assumed to have long 
uptimes, and this operation only needs to occur once on server startup. This 
administrator is also tasked with verifying the server's public key out-of-band with 
users, therefore he can be trusted to do this too.
</p>
<h3>Mechanism to Defend Against Threat 9</h3>
<p>
In order to defend against this threat, a mechanism must be developed to protect 
the existence of the server's private RSA key on disk, so that even if the 
key is physically stolen, it cannot be used by an attacker to host a fake  
server. This can be achieved through the use of the "starter's" (server 
administrator's) private key. On the execution of the server, the starter's 
private RSA key (which the starter will type in manually) is used to generate a 
confidentiality and integrity key that will be used to encrypt and verify the 
server's private RSA key when it is loaded from disk. 
The two keys are <b>k<sub>c</sub></b>, used for encryption, 
and <b>k<sub>i</sub></b> which is used for integrity checks. The keys are

with "confidentiality" and "integrity" respectively. After the server 
private key is successfully loaded and verified, it is used as normal throughout 
the system as outlined in our previous phases.
</p>
<p>
This mechanism is sufficient for defending against this threat. 
The server administrator (starter) is tasked with the responsibility 
of keeping his/her private RSA key (used to create <b>k<sub>c</sub></b> and 
<b>k<sub>i</sub></b> to protect the server private RSA key) safe from 
compromise. This key derivation is safe due to the property of preimage resistance
mentioned in T8. This means that the key used to protect the server private key 
is not present on the system, and will not be stolen in the result of a machine 
compromise of any verified server. It is acceptable to require the starter of a 
server to type in a full RSA key as both servers are assumed to have long 
uptimes, and this operation only needs to occur once on server startup. This 
administrator is also tasked with verifying the server's public key out-of-band with 
users, therefore he can be trusted to do this too.
</p>
<h3>Mechanism to Defend Against Threat 10</h3> 
<p>
When users upload a file to the file server, they create a confidentiality and 
integrity key from the evolving key that they are provided by the group server. 
The confidentiality key is used to encrypt  the file, while the integrity key is 
used to key an HMAC based on SHA-256. This HMAC is then uploaded to the file 
server along with the file.
</p>
<p>
This mechanism is sufficient to defend against the threat as the file server can 
no longer change the file without causing a mismatch in the compared HMACs. The 
HMAC is keyed with an integrity key that is secret from the file server, 
therefore the file server cannot recompute this HMAC.
</p>
<h3>Mechanism to Defend Against Threat 11</h3>
<p>
The mechanism to defend against this threat is to simply add a new field to a 
group object that identifies it with a unique identifier rather than a group 
name. This allows for any number of groups with any given alias to exist. This new 
identifier is then used with the group name (now the group alias) for all 
operations to identify specific groups. This identifier is formatted as the 
group alias concatenated with a randomly generated string.
</p>
<p>
This mechanism is sufficient for defending against the threat due to users no 
longer being able to create a new group that possesses the same unique 
identifier as a previously deleted group. A user can also create any 
number of groups with any given alias, so they would never receive an error 
message that would indicate if a group with a given identifier already existed. 
The random string is generated using Java.Security.SecureRandom and is 128 bits 
long. This ensures that two groups will not end up with the same random string.
</p>
<h3>Mechanism to Defend Against Threat 12</h3>
<p>
The mechanism to defend this threat is the addition of computational puzzles to 
the connection process. When a client tries to connect to a group server, they 
will be given a hash of <b>n</b> bits along with the solution of the puzzle 
concatenated with a timestamp, encrypted with the server's public key. They 
must solve this puzzle and include the answer and the encrypted chunk with their 
login request. 
</p>
<p>
This mechanism is sufficient to address this threat because very little state is 
used on the server-side while a adequate of computational resources are used on 
the client side. The encrypted answer is sent to the user (forcing them to keep 
track of the state) to minimize the resource disparity between the client and 
server. Due to the setting where this system will be deployed in (a business 
environment where all computers are pretty much the same and also decently 
powerful), a computational puzzle such as this is reasonable to have a client 
solve. While this sort of defense does not adequately stop an attack by large 
nation-states and motivated attackers, some defense is far greater than none.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
<!-- BEGIN CHANGES HERE -->

<p>Conclude with a paragraph or two discussing your threat model and
countermeasure mechanisms. How realistic is your threat model for a real-life
file sharing system? Comment on the design process that your group followed. Did
you discuss other ideas that didn’t pan out before settling on the
above-documented approach? Did you design attacks that you were unable to
mitigate, or that you think are impossible to mitigate? Use this space to show
off your hard work!</p>

<p>
Our threat model is overly ambitious for even the most secure-minded environments
and users. Many reasonable assumptions for a file sharing system that may be
applied for such a system to be considered secure must fail for some of our
protection mechanisms to come into play. Such as the extremely weak assumptions
made on the ability for a server to keep its own files isolated on its local machine. Furthermore,
all of the security measures implemented for our system makes it inconvenient
for use by both the users and the administrators. Our design process was that
general testing of the system and looking over protocol overviews from the previous
phases led us to discover where we made mistakes (such as with information leakage
via non-unique group names) and where we made some implicit assumptions of stronger
trust than what is outlined herein. Some of our ideas did not pan out, such as
thinking our system did not have plausible deniability. We realized that the signed
Diffie-Hellman protocol actually does provide such a characteristic, but we had planned
on an encrypted Diffie-Hellman protocol and outlined it before realizing we had already acheived
plausible deniability. The one attack we are unable to fully defend against is DoS, as
there are really no 100% guaranteed protections against such an attack at the moment, or even
mostly correct defenses that do not require a fair bit of sophistication. We can only
stop small-scale DoS and DDoS attacks with our countermeasures. 
</p>

<p>Finally, spend a paragraph discussing the interplay between the
countermeasures for your proposed attacks and your techniques for mitigating
threats T1–T7 from Phases P3 and P4 of the project. Did you have to design your
countermeasures in a particular way so as not to re-introduce these older
threats?</p>

<p>
There was no overlap between the threats for P5 and the past phases. The private asymmetric keys
are now split into confidentiallity and integrity keys. The DoS threat is entirely separate from all
past protocols and counter-measures. The only change that affect the previous phases deals with fixing an oversight from the previous
phases in the information leakage from group naming. No past threats were reintroduced.
</p>

<p>If your group implemented the countermeasures or did any extra credit, please
discuss these additional contributions in this section, as well.</p>

<h3>Extra stuff</h3>
- DDoS, write a program that does this. <br>
- Group name collisions that I discuss in the TODO.
